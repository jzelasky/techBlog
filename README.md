## Usage

When visiting the blog for the first time you will be able to view the homepage with a list recent posts, but to view the full post or comment you will need to create an account. To create an account, click on the login link in the navagation bar. Create a username and password (must be at least 8 characters) in the "Create new user" form. If the password is valid, your account will be created and you will be automatically logged in. 

Once logged in, you can navigate to the homepage or your personal dashboard through links in the navagation bar. 

The homepage contains a list of all posts and the dates they were created. If you click on a post, you will be brought to a page with the full details of the post including comments if there are any. To leave a comment, click on "Post a comment", enter your comment when prompted, and click ok. Note: deleting and editing comments is not supported at this time

Your dashboard contains all the posts you have written and an option to create a new post. If you click the "create new post" button, you will be brought to a page where you can enter a title and body for your post. Once you click submit, the post will be live. You can also edit and delete your posts from your dashboard by clicking the "edit" and "delete" links. To view comments on your post, click "view comments".

When you are finished using this tech blog, you can click "logout" in the navagation bar and you will be logged out. Alternatively, if you are idle on the site for more than 10 minutes, you will be automatically logged out. To log back in, click "login" in the navagation bar (if you are not already on the log in page), enter your username and password and click "submit".
